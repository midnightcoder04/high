# Projects

## Patient-Doctor Consultancy
A responsive full-stack website created using Node.js, Python, Flask, and MySQL.
The website streamlines patient-doctor communication andallows patients to
request appointments and schedule meetings via Google Meet links. It was a 
1 day freelance work as the client wanted the working site asap and hence the
main focus was on the functionality rather than the UI.
